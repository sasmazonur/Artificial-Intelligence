# Goal
Predict the sentiment sentences taken from Yelp reviews, using data from. Program uses Naive Bayes for this classification problem. Given an input sentence, program determines whether a sentence is positive or negative.

# How it Works
* In the training phase, the Naive Bayes classifier reads in the training data along with the training labels and learns the parameters used by the classifier
* In the testing phase, the trained naive Bayes classifier classifies the data in the test set files
* Output the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier by comparing the predicted class label of each sentence in the test data to the actual class label. 
* The accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.
