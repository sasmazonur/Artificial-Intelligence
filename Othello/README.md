# Abstract
Othello (also known as Reversi) is a classic two-player, turn-based game in which players try to flip as many pieces over to their color as possible.

The program implemented using the Minimax algorithm.

# How To Play
The player that moves first is assumed to be the maximizing player.
If the computer player goes second, computer will always win or tie.

The command line allows you to select whether a player is a human player or a computer player. We will only be grading your assignment with the human player moving first and the Minimax player moving second.
