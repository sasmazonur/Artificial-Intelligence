# Abstract
This program solves the chickens and wolves puzzle using uninformed and informed search algorithms. The algorithms used are breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative deepening depth-first search, and A-star search.

## Goal:
This code will print out the states along the solution path from the start state to the goal state. If no such path exists, code will print out a no solution found message.

## Results:

The results of all the test cases, follow up with our expectations, but there are some ordinary results. ASTAR performed best, the second was BFS, third IDDFS, and last was DFS.
The ordinary case is that IDDFS test case 3 does not have an optimal solution, which was expected, but it still performed better solution steps than DFS.
